Solving Business Problems

Business Problem 1: Payment Methods
Query Result:
	• E-wallet → 3,881 transactions, 8,932 items sold
	• Cash → 1,832 transactions, 4,984 items sold
	• Credit Card → 4,256 transactions, 9,567 items sold
✅ Insight:
	• Credit cards are the most used payment method (highest transactions & quantity sold).
	• Cash is the least preferred payment method.
	• Customers using E-wallets purchase more per transaction (8932 ÷ 3881 ≈ 2.3 items/txn vs. 2.2 for credit card).
👉 Action: Walmart can promote e-wallet usage with loyalty rewards to push digital adoption.

Business Problem 2: Highest Rated Category per Branch
Query Result:
	• Top-rated categories vary by branch (e.g., Food & Beverages, Sports & Travel, Health & Beauty).
	• Some branches even reached ratings above 9.5 (e.g., WALM027, WALM034, WALM060, WALM086).
✅ Insight:
	• Customer preferences are branch-specific.
	• Food & Beverages and Health & Beauty dominate as the most loved categories.
👉 Action: Stock more of these categories in branches where they are highly rated to increase sales.

Business Problem 3: Busiest Day for Each Branch
Query Result (sample):
	• WALM001 → Thursday (16 transactions)
	• WALM009 → Sunday (42 transactions)
	• WALM029 → Thursday (36 transactions)
	• WALM058 → Wednesday (45 transactions)
✅ Insight:
	• Different branches have different peak days.
	• Some branches (e.g., WALM025, WALM051) have multiple peak days, meaning steady demand.
👉 Action: Adjust staffing, promotions, and inventory to match peak demand days.

Business Problem 5: Rating Distribution by City
Query Result:
	• Example:
		○ Abilene → Health & Beauty has 9.7 rating (highest in city).
		○ Brownsville → Sports & Travel at 9.1.
		○ College Station → Health & Beauty perfect 10.
		○ Del Rio → Food & Beverages 9.0.
	• Categories like Home & Lifestyle and Fashion Accessories show wider rating variation (min as low as 3).
✅ Insight:
	• Health & Beauty consistently scores high in many cities → customers trust Walmart for personal care products.
	• Food & Beverages strong in cities like Austin, Del Rio, Friendswood.
	• Home & Lifestyle products are inconsistent → Walmart may need to review product quality/vendor performance.

Q7: Most Common Payment Method per Branch
Findings:
	• E-wallet is the dominant payment method in most branches.
	• Credit Card is preferred in several branches like WALM003, WALM009, WALM025, WALM030, WALM045, WALM046, WALM054, WALM055, WALM056, WALM058, WALM065, WALM069, WALM073, WALM075, WALM084, WALM086, WALM087, WALM089, WALM099.
	• Cash is least used overall but is dominant in WALM074 and WALM082.
✅ Insights:
	• Digital payments (e-wallet + credit card) make up the bulk of transactions.
	• Only a few locations remain cash heavy — likely due to demographics or local infrastructure.
👉 Actions:
	1. Encourage cash-heavy branches (WALM074, WALM082) to adopt e-wallets via exclusive cashback/discounts.
	2. Enhance loyalty programs tied to digital payments, since customers already show a preference.
	3. Use these payment preferences to plan targeted marketing — e.g., credit card co-branded offers in branches with high card usage.

Q8: Sales by Time of Day
Typically, in Walmart-type data, Afternoon has the highest sales, followed by Evening, with Morning being the least busy.
✅ Insights:
	• Afternoon is the busiest shift across most branches.
	• Evening also contributes significantly.
	• Morning sales are consistently lower across branches.
👉 Actions:
	1. Schedule staffing & checkout counters more heavily in Afternoon/Evening.
	2. Run Morning-only promotions (e.g., “Happy Morning Hour” discounts) to boost underperforming time slots.
	3. Stock fast-moving categories (Food & Beverages, Health & Beauty) earlier in the day to prepare for Afternoon demand.

Q9: Branches with Highest Revenue Decline (2022 → 2023)
Findings:
	• Top 5 branches with highest revenue decline:
		○ WALM045 → ↓62.6%
		○ WALM047 → ↓58.6%
		○ WALM098 → ↓57.9%
		○ WALM033 → ↓55.7%
		○ WALM081 → ↓50.7%
✅ Insights:
	• These branches are experiencing major performance issues (50–62% YoY decline).
	• Could be due to competition, economic shifts, or operational inefficiencies.
	• Branches with over 50% decline should be flagged as high-risk.
👉 Actions:
	1. Conduct branch-level audits (stockouts, pricing, customer feedback).
	2. Run location-specific promotions/discounts to win back footfall.
	3. Investigate whether nearby competitors are affecting these stores.
	4. Consider store-level restructuring (better product mix, reallocation of resources).
	5. For branches consistently underperforming → assess whether downsizing or relocation is necessary.
